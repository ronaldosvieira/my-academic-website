  abstract  = {Collectible card games are played by tens of millions of players worldwide. Their intricate rules and diverse cards make them much more complex than traditional card games. To win, players must be proficient in two interdependent tasks: deck building and battling. In this paper, we present a deep reinforcement learning approach for deck building in arena mode - an understudied game mode present in many collectible card games, in which players build decks immediately before battling by drafting one card at a time from randomly presented candidates. We investigate three variants of the approach, and perform experiments on Legends of Code and Magic, a collectible card game designed for AI research. Results show that our learned draft strategies outperform those of the best agents of the game. Moreover, a participant of the Strategy Card Game AI competition improves from tenth to fourth place when coupled with our best drafting approach.},

abstract    = {Collectible card games (CCGs), such as Magic: the Gathering and Hearthstone, are played by tens of millions of players worldwide, and their vast state and action spaces, intricate rules and diverse cards make them challenging for humans and artificial intelligence (AI) agents alike. In them, players build a deck using cards that representcreatures, items or spells from a fantasy world and use it to battle other players. Therefore, to win, players must be proficient in two interdependent tasks: deck building and battling. The advent of strong and fast AI players would enable, for instance, thorough playtesting of new cards before they are made available to the public, which is a longstanding problem in the CCG industry. In this thesis, we present a deep reinforcement learning approach for deck-building in the arena mode – an understudied game mode present in most commercial collectible card games. In arena, players build decks immediately before battling by drafting one card at a time from randomly presented candidates. We formulate the problem in a game-agnostic manner and investigate three approaches that differ on how to consider the cards drafted so far in the next choices, using different game state representations and types of neural networks. We perform experiments on Legends of Code and Magic, a collectible card game designed for AI research. Considering the win rate of the decks when used by fixed battling AIs, the results show that our trained draft agents outperform the best draft agents of the game, and do so by building very different decks. Moreover, a participant of the Strategy Card Game AIcompetition improves from tenth to fourth place when using our best draft agent to build decks. We conclude with a discussion on the results, contributions and limitations of this work as well as directions for future research.},

  abstract  = {Games have long been a popular application area for research on artificial intelligence. They provide hard and diverse challenges whose solution often apply to real-life problems. Games like Chess, Go and recently Poker can be played by computers at superhuman level, but this performance is yet to be achieved in more complex games, such as collectible card games. To tackle this problem, we propose a pure reinforcement learning approach to the card game Legends of Code and Magic, in contrast to search strategies, most commonly used in this domain. In this paper, we present the intended methodology, preliminary results and the next steps of the project.},

  title={Modelando um esconde-esconde no Minecraft utilizando Hidden Markov Model},
  abstract={A criação de agentes inteligentes é uma área da inteligência artificial que busca construir entidades capazes de desempenhar ações semelhantes aos seres humanos. Dessa forma, é possível modelar cenários e avaliar a tomada de decisão de entidades envolvidas nesses cenários. Este trabalho consiste na construção de agentes inteligentes para participarem da brincadeira de esconde-esconde. Para isso, é desenvolvida uma abordagem probabilística baseada em um Hidden Markov Model, que utiliza o jogo Minecraft como plataforma para sua aplicação. Os experimentos realizados demonstram que a estratégia desenvolvida permite a interação entre os agentes de forma adequada às regras da brincadeira.},

  title     = {A Cognitive Architecture for Agent-Based Artificial Life Simulation},
  abstract  = {The ability to simulate living beings that behave in a credible way is a fundamental aspect in digital games. This is due to its interdisciplinary characteristic, that brings together different fields of knowledge to better understand biological life and its processes. In this context, the design of an intelligent agent is a hard task as it involves a complex system, which has several interconnected components. In this work a virtual mind architecture for intelligent agents is proposed, where it simulates the cognitive processes of an actual brain, in this case attention and memory, in order to reproduce behaviors similar to those of actual living beings. A prototype is then proposed, where the architecture is applied on agents that represent virtual animals in a semantic-modeled ecosystem, and conduct a proof-of-concept experiment with it to demonstrate its effectiveness. In this experiment, the behavior of the virtual animals were consistent with reality, thus, validating the architecture’s ability to simulate living beings.},
