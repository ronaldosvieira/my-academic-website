I'm a PhD student at the Computer Science department of Universidade Federal of Minas Gerais (UFMG). I received a MSc degree in Computer Science from the same university in 2020, and a BSc degree in Computer Science from Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ) in 2017, with a sandwich period at University of British Columbia (UBC) from 2014 to 2015. I'm also a member of the [Multidisciplinary Research Lab. on Games (J Lab)](http://www.j.dcc.ufmg.br/){:target="\_blank"} and of the [Vision and Robotics Lab. (VeRLab)](https://www.verlab.dcc.ufmg.br/){:target="\_blank"}.

My research interests include artificial intelligence in games and distributed multiagent systems. I'm currently working on game-playing AI agents for collectible card games and real-time strategy games.
