I'm a member of the [Multidisciplinary Research Lab. on Games (J Lab)](http://www.j.dcc.ufmg.br/){:target="\_blank"} and of the [Vision and Robotics Lab. (VeRLab)](https://www.verlab.dcc.ufmg.br/){:target="\_blank"}.

My research interests include artificial intelligence in games and multiagent systems. I'm currently working on game-playing AI agents for collectible card games and real-time strategy games.

I like soccer (as any Ronaldo would) and sports in general, digital and tabletop games (especially RPGs), memes, not taking myself too seriously, and being with empathetic, open-minded people.
